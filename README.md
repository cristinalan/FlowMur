## How to start
This example is for the following setting:

dataset --> Google Speech Command Dataset V2

target model --> SmallCNNï¼›surrogate model --> LargeCNN

#class of $D$ --> 10; #class of $D_{aux}$ --> 25; #class of $D_{sur}$ --> 26

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Extract audio features for $D$ and $D_{sur}$ respectively.
```shell
python data_preprocessing.py
```
### Step 2: Obtain the Surrogate Model
Train the surrogate model on $D_{sur}$
```shell
python Benign_Model.py
```
### Step 3: Generate the Trigger
Optimize the trigger on the surrogate model
```shell
python generate_trigger.py
```
### Step 4: Data Poisoning and Backdoor Injection
Poison $D$ and train SmallCNN on poisonous $D$
```shell
python Attack.py
```
